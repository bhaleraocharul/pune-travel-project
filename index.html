            <h3>Pune, the Queen of Deccan</h3>
            <p>
              As Pune was the best city on the Deccan Plateau, it was given the
              name of Queen of Deccan. Pune, the cultural capital of Maharashtra
              was once the capital of Peshwas as it became the political centre
              of the Indian subcontinent. Home to many colleges and
              universities, it is considered a pretigious educational
              destination, winning itself the title of "The Oxford of the East".
              Legend has it that Punekars (people from Pune) are more sarcastic
              than the infamous Chandler Bing!
